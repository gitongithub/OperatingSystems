According to Banker's Algorithm, 
The System is in a safe state.
One of the possible safe order is :- <P0, P3, P1, P2, P4>
Note: This is just one of the possible safe orders.
The order of P0, P3 shall remain same and after that any of the processes can  be selected.
Hence, 
 <P0, P3, P1, P4, P2>
 <P0, P3, P2, P1, P4>
 <P0, P3, P2, P4, P1>
 <P0, P3, P4, P2, P1>
 <P0, P3, P4, P1, P2>
are also valid safe orders. (Since answer is yes, explanation isn't required as per classroom comments).
